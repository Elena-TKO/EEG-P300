# P300
The P300 (P3) wave is an event-related potential component elicited in the process of decision making.  

When recorded by electroencephalography (EEG), it surfaces as a positive deflection in voltage with a latency (delay between stimulus and response) of roughly 250 to 500 ms.  

The goal is to allocate from EEG signal P300 using coherent averaging.
